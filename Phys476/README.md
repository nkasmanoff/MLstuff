PHYS476
--------

This repository contains my code from the class Physics 476, Applied Machine Learning taught at the University of Maryland. 
There have been various labs and homeworks, all included below.


The notebooks are where I did most of the code experimenting, where the 113444234*.py files are what were submitted for grading.
