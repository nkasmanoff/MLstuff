-Submit an approved topic on time, in a form that is of reasonable quality
-Finish a reasonably large amount of work (this doesn’t necessarily mean your code has to 100%
work by presentation time).
-Don’t do anything stupid we’ve covered in class in setting up your ML models (i.e., using an auto
encoder when you shouldn’t, using an unrelated loss function, etc.)

-Present the work via code walk-through (like Justin would do in class for demo purposes... section by section discussion) plus show us what happens when it runs and discuss the results, including whether they are good/reasonable if it works and what may be wrong if it doesn't.

Outline 

Introduction:

Since the winter of 1891, following the day Dr. James Naismith nailed a peach basket into a gym wall, basketball has evolved into a true American game (NMHOF, 2008). Nearly 270,000 people, each game day, attend basketball arenas around the country to watch the best of the best sweat, hustle, and entertain (Ibisworld, 2008). Along with watching the games, millions of fans are involved with the ever growing arena of fantasy basketball leagues and other gambling alternatives. Involvement in these leagues and gambling precipitates the desire to know which team will win before they even participate in a game.


In this paper we examine the use of neural networks as tool for predicting the success of basketball teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Further, we investigate which subset of features input to the neural nets are the most salient features for prediction.

In this project we examine the utilities of machine learning as tools for predicting the spread of basketball games along with the expected winner of said spread, the future success of NBA teams based on historical trends, the future development of players, and all these other things




Still want to do:

Hot encode teams into the game predictor

Maybe change to previous 5 or 10 games?
