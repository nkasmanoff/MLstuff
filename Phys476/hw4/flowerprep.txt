In order to prepare all these flowers to be sent through a  CNN to identify them:


They are currently all in separate directories, under flowers/ w/ a sub folder for each.

All the images are different lengths and widths. 

 
 To make this into an ordinary ML training data set, a few things need to be done first.


 All the images have to be in the same directory, using the typical X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test etc. 


 Assign these labels as you go, make daisy's 1,0,0,.. etc. can do this after pushing all the type of flower into the directory making an array of the same length w/ the assigned class. Mash these all together.



 Next after all the flowers are inside,  you need to find the best dimensions to use.


 Finding the max length and width is already done, you could possibly rescale all the images to fit in one size, or we add a black space to fit all the pictures without rescaling


Rescaling:
Pros: 
 Rescaling is easy
Cons:
 Messes up resolution, some pictures will definitely be ruined as a result

Blackspace:
Pros:
 Image dimensions won't be ruined
Cons:
 Harder to do
 CNN might pick the black space as a filter, causing issues when IDing


 We should start w rescaling, and do the other next if it doesn't work.
